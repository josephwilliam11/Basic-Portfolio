			I was born in Steamboat Springs, Colorado but was raised in Houston, Texas until age 12. My parents moved my brother, Ryan and I, to Grand Junction, Colorado. Moving from a huge city to a small town was a huge shock for me but I grew to love living close to the mountains and eventually learned to deal with winter.

			After high school I moved to California to play baseball at a Junior College. I went on to play at Mount Mercy University in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. While in school I earned my BA in English because I wanted to be a baseball coach and teacher.  Today, I live in Capitol Hill, Denver. I enjoy playing softball, basketball, skateboarding, and hiking.
